Campfire is a p2p video chat application made by Holium. It works by establishing a WebRTC connection using Urbit as a signaling channel.

# Install troubleshooting

If you have trouble installing, the most common issue is users also having %urchatfm installed. Since %campfire is a fork of %urchatfm they have overlapping Gall agents, so you can't have both installed at the same time.

```
|uninstall %urchatfm
```

# Features

- Voice and video calling
- Screensharing
- File sharing
- %pals speed dialing
- URL speed dialing `/apps/campfire/call/~sampel-palnet` to initiate a call with ~sampel-palnet

# Credits

This work was only possible because of the original [urbit-webrtc](https://github.com/urbit/urbit-webrtc) project that built out the gall agents (`switchboard` now named `rtcswitchboard` and `icepond`) as well as the prototype urchatfm frontend application.
